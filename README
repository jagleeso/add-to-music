USAGE
    add-to-music [path_1, path_2, ..., path_N]

DESCRIPTION
    Move all the music files from the specified directories/files to your music library 
    using their artist/album tags to determine where to put them.  When importing 
    directories, cleanup all the junk files that remain (e.g. text files, playlist files, 
    etc.). 

    When importing a directory, we assume that all the music files contained in it should 
    have matching artist/album tags.  If they don't, a prompt will be given to choose 
    which tags to use as directories for storing the files. 

    Currently supported music files:
    mp3, m4a, ogg, flac

    Currently supported cover art files:
    jpg, gif, png

    Filetypes to delete:
    m3u, pls, wpl, cue, nfo, sfv, txt

OPTIONS
    --library, -l
        Directory in which to import music files to.  Music files are imported as:
            <LIBRARY>/<ARTIST>/<ALBUM>
        where artist/album information is determined by reading the tags of audio files.
        default: /home/james/Music

    --force, -f
        If set, then when importing a directory, if there are multiple album/artist 
        combinations for audio files, just choose the one with the majority.  Otherwise, 
        if it's not set, prompt the user for a choice.
        default: off
